        <h2>Development</h2>
        <p>The development of the game started just a month after the release of GTA San Andreas.Cases of employees working 12 hours during production were reported.A very interesting fact is that GTA 4 broke the record as the most expensive game in history, with production costs exceeding 100 million dollars. Today there are games with higher production costs, but GTA 4 was the most expensive of its time</p>
        <h3>Liberty City</h3>
        <p>The developers based Liberty City on New York City, this city also existed in previous games (GTA III), but they decided to make a totally new map, putting the most interesting of New York City in the design. We all know that New York City is one of the most representative cities of the United States.</p>
        <p>Rockstar created a research team  to be based in New York City, who sent them the required information, plus hundreds of photos and videos of the city.The developers went further, they read about the architecture of the city, its sewage system, its subways , etc.It is interesting that liberty city has brands of fictitious companies, which the player can see in advertisements in the city.</p>

        <h3>Script</h3>
        <p>The script was done step by step, first a synopsis in which Dan Houser had the help of his brother Sam Houser and also Leslie Benzie's,then they were organizing the missions and their flow (based on the plot they had)</p>
        <p>They put a lot of effort into the script, Dan Houser thought that the plot of the games should evolve into something deeper and not just copy scenes from famous movies.</p>
        <p>They gave a lot of importance to Niko and his relationship with the people of the city, many characters being hostile towards Niko. Niko in the plot does not mind suffering and endangering his life, he just wants to protect his cousin and his revenge.But Niko does not kill for pleasure, he does it for the circumstances in which he is. Whenever he can, Niko refrains from hurting and sometimes saves other people that he considers innocent</p>

        <h3>Petrovic and Faustin</h3>
        <p>niko and roman are kidnapped by Mikhail Faustin's and Dimitri Rascalov's henchmen, russian mobsters, but faustin doesn't care much about vlad's death and simply forces niko to become his hitman.Dimitri is the second in command of that mafia, the lider , is faustin and  he ordered niko to assassinate the son of Kenny Petrovic, petrovic being one of the most important criminal leaders, and the most powerful russian mobster in the united states.Niko succeeds in killing petrovic's son, then petrovic threatens to kill all the members of faustin's criminal organization.Rascalov tells niko that it is best to kill faustin because of his violent personality and the erratic acts he was committing. </p>
        <h3>Escape to bohan</h3>
        <p>Niko and Rascalov make a plan to kill Faustin, and this plan worked, but then Rascalov reveals to Niko that he is  partner of Ray Bulgarin, who was his boss and believes that Niko had betrayed him in the past during a human trafficking operation.Niko and Little Jacob (Niko's partner) escaped alive from the shooting.Dimitri's men destroy Roman's apartment and taxi company, Roman's girlfriend Mallorie helps them escape to Bohan, where they hide out with Mallorie's cousins.</p>
        <p>Nico meets various local mob bosses in bohan (Playboy, Elizabeta, Dwayne), and does jobs for them.Niko is also forced by Francis McReary (police chief) to kill certain people he needs to get rid of.</p>
        <h3>Roman's kidnapping and the bank robbery</h3>
        <p>Roman is kidnapped again by Dimitri's men, but Niko easily rescues him. Roman luckily receives insurance money, because his company was destroyed, so Roman rebuilds his company and buys an apartment in Algonquin.Niko meets Packie McReary (Francis McReary's brother), who is a member of the Irish mob,and starts working for them, also earns their trust and starts dating packie's sister, Kate McReary.Niko helps the McReary brothers to carry out a bank robbery, possibly the most remembered and emblematic mission of the game.</p>
        <h3>Ray Boccino and Florian</h3>
        <p>Niko meets Ray Boccino through packie, who gives Niko a job, it's about Niko supervising a diamond deal. This one goes wrong, and ends in a shootout between Niko and Bulgarin and finally the diamonds are lost in garbage.</p>
        <p>Ray helped niko track down the possible traitor that niko was looking for (who betrayed his squad in the  Yugoslavian Wars), ray did this for niko to repay him for his help in the diamond deal.When Niko meets Florian (the possible traitor) he realizes that he could not be the one who betrayed them, also it can be seen that Florian (now called Bernie) is homosexual in a strange but funny scene.Niko and Bernie become good friends, and Niko helps Bernie's boyfriend (Deputy Mayor Bryce Dawkins) ward off the blackmailers.</p>
        <h3>Niko meets the traitor</h3>
        <p>Niko personally meets Pegorino's leader Jimmy Pegorino who first asks niko to kill Boccino, as he suspects he may be an undercover police officer.United Liberty Paper (A company that niko works for, because one of his ex-girlfriends, Michelle, was an agent who blackmailed him to work for them) gives Niko the person he was looking for, Darko, who is the traitor.Darko admits to betraying them and the player is free to kill him or not in the game, though Roman tells Niko not to do so.</p>
        <h3>The final mission</h3>
        <p>in the final event of the game Jimmy Pegorino asks niko to help him with a heroin exchange deal, in collaboration with dimitri.This clearly puts niko in a difficult situation, as he still wants to take revenge on dimitri for what he did to him.At this point the player can also decide which way to go: either take revenge on Dimitri or accept the deal with him.the game has two possible endings depending on the player's decision:</p>
        <h3>Final 1</h3>
        <p>If niko accepts the deal dimitri betrays them and steals all the heroin, then at roman's wedding, an assassin is sent to kill niko, but ends up accidentally killing roman.After this occurs the final mission where niko with the help of little jacob finally kills dimitri (who had killed pegorino).</p>
        <h3>Final 2</h3>
        <p>If niko decides to take revenge on dimitri, niko simply looks for and finds dimitri on the same cargo ship where nico arrived in the united states.Niko Kills dimitri, after this pegorino sends assassins to kill niko (also at roman's wedding), but these assassins kill kate, who is niko's girlfriend.Later, niko with the help of little jacob and roman track pegorino, and finally niko put and end to him.</p>

        <h2>personal opinion </h2>
        <p>I think the game is really fun and its plot may be dramatic and dark at times.The graphics looks great compared to gta san andreas (the prevous game) and you will have different events with the npc's but less than in gta 5 (the later game)  </p>
        <p>Some gameplay features are a bit annoying like driving, which is awkward and confusing for players.Another thing that is negative about the game is that it has missions that feel unnecessary  and with very long shootings and awkwar  d gameplay.</p>
        <p>I like that the game has a more serious and dark atmosphere, you can even see that the graphics of the game reflect it.It does not have the same sense of humor of GTA san andres and GTA 5, but I think that's okay, it's a video game that innovated and treated its script a little more seriously.The decisions that the player makes during the game also seemed to me to be ok, since they give depth to niko, we can know what he really thinks, and the final decision changes the end of the game.</p>
        <p>There is no denying that the game has fun and action-packed missions, and the open world is the best part of the game.Exploring Liberty City and the activities it offers to the player is very addictive and entertaining.If you play the game you will see that you will not get bored in the city, exploring it is the most important part of the gameplay</p>

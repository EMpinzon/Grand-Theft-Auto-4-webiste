        <h2>Release</h2>
        <p>At E3 in May 2006 the game was announced and the game was released on April 24, 2008.The game was highly anticipated at the time, probably the most anticipated game of 2008.In 2009 two dlc packs were released for the xbox 360, which later in 2010 were available for ps3 and windows.these dlc were Grand Theft Auto IV: The Lost and Damned and Grand Theft Auto: The Ballad of Gay Tony, two separate stories that occur in the same time period, and whose events sometimes overlap.These two dlc are also remembered by the community of GTA fans, for their charismatic characters and their interesting plots.</p>
        <h2>Development</h2>
        <p>The development of the game started just a month after the release of GTA San Andreas.Cases of employees working 12 hours during production were reported.A very interesting fact is that GTA 4 broke the record as the most expensive game in history, with production costs exceeding 100 million dollars. Today there are games with higher production costs, but GTA 4 was the most expensive of its time</p>
        <h3>Liberty City</h3>
        <p>The developers based Liberty City on New York City, this city also existed in previous games (GTA III), but they decided to make a totally new map, putting the most interesting of New York City in the design. We all know that New York City is one of the most representative cities of the United States.</p>
        <p>Rockstar created a research team  to be based in New York City, who sent them the required information, plus hundreds of photos and videos of the city.The developers went further, they read about the architecture of the city, its sewage system, its subways , etc.It is interesting that liberty city has brands of fictitious companies, which the player can see in advertisements in the city.</p>
        <p>The team created npc with a variety of crazy personalities, Dan Houser described New York as a city full of crazy and fascinating people.</p>

        <h3>Script</h3>
        <p>The script was done step by step, first a synopsis in which Dan Houser had the help of his brother Sam Houser and also Leslie Benzie's,then they were organizing the missions and their flow (based on the plot they had)</p>
        <p>They put a lot of effort into the script, Dan Houser thought that the plot of the games should evolve into something deeper and not just copy scenes from famous movies.</p>
        <p>They gave a lot of importance to Niko and his relationship with the people of the city, many characters being hostile towards Niko. Niko in the plot does not mind suffering and endangering his life, he just wants to protect his cousin and his revenge.But Niko does not kill for pleasure, he does it for the circumstances in which he is. Whenever he can, Niko refrains from hurting and sometimes saves other people that he considers innocent</p>
        <p>The team focused on the missions not being so linear, which was something that characterized gta san andreas</p>
        <p>Each important character in the game has a very representative personality, the developers thought it would be a good idea to use funny and serious characters at the same time to generate contrast (like niko and roman).Each location in the game is based on a New York location, the clothes, behaviors, dialogues, and even languages of the npc change according to the location where you are.</p>

        <h3> Art style </h3>
        <p>The art of the game, that is, the images that you see in the menus, loading screens, cover art, etc... these images are the representation of the characters and the city.This art was redesigned, in gta 4 it is more detailed and realistic.the new art design is more suitable for the more serious and darker story it shows, it also suits the graphics of the game, which look more grey and dirty.</p>
        <p>The more detailed art was possible thanks to the new consoles of that time, which already had hd technology included.The designers also wanted to change the cartoon-like art style of the previous games for a more visually striking art.</p>

        <h3>music</h3>
        <p>The development team licensed music from many bands and musicians, this was quite costly, but it shaped the soundtrack of the game.Rockstar had to contact at least 2,000 people in order to get the songs for the game.They were even able to ask Jamaican dancehall artists to re-record their songs so that these songs make references to liberty city.</p>

        <h3>Beginning and the murder of vlad</h3>
        <p>Niko came to the united states to pursue the american dream and reunite with his cousin, but is quickly forced to work for Vlad Glebov, a mobster to whom roman owes money.Niko begins to resent him because of the way vlad treats him, and after a while niko kills him when niko finds out that he had slept with his cousin's girlfriend.  </p>
        <h3>Petrovic and Faustin</h3>
        <p>niko and roman are kidnapped by Mikhail Faustin's and Dimitri Rascalov's henchmen, russian mobsters, but faustin doesn't care much about vlad's death and simply forces niko to become his hitman.Dimitri is the second in command of that mafia, the lider , is faustin and  he ordered niko to assassinate the son of Kenny Petrovic, petrovic being one of the most important criminal leaders, and the most powerful russian mobster in the united states.Niko succeeds in killing petrovic's son, then petrovic threatens to kill all the members of faustin's criminal organization.Rascalov tells niko that it is best to kill faustin because of his violent personality and the erratic acts he was committing. </p>
        <h3>Escape to bohan</h3>
        <p>Niko and Rascalov make a plan to kill Faustin, and this plan worked, but then Rascalov reveals to Niko that he is  partner of Ray Bulgarin, who was his boss and believes that Niko had betrayed him in the past during a human trafficking operation.Niko and Little Jacob (Niko's partner) escaped alive from the shooting.Dimitri's men destroy Roman's apartment and taxi company, Roman's girlfriend Mallorie helps them escape to Bohan, where they hide out with Mallorie's cousins.</p>
        <p>Nico meets various local mob bosses in bohan (Playboy, Elizabeta, Dwayne), and does jobs for them.Niko is also forced by Francis McReary (police chief) to kill certain people he needs to get rid of.</p>
        <h3>Roman's kidnapping and the bank robbery</h3>
        <p>Roman is kidnapped again by Dimitri's men, but Niko easily rescues him. Roman luckily receives insurance money, because his company was destroyed, so Roman rebuilds his company and buys an apartment in Algonquin.Niko meets Packie McReary (Francis McReary's brother), who is a member of the Irish mob,and starts working for them, also earns their trust and starts dating packie's sister, Kate McReary.Niko helps the McReary brothers to carry out a bank robbery, possibly the most remembered and emblematic mission of the game.</p>
        <h3>Ray Boccino and Florian</h3>
        <p>Niko meets Ray Boccino through packie, who gives Niko a job, it's about Niko supervising a diamond deal. This one goes wrong, and ends in a shootout between Niko and Bulgarin and finally the diamonds are lost in garbage.</p>
        <p>Ray helped niko track down the possible traitor that niko was looking for (who betrayed his squad in the  Yugoslavian Wars), ray did this for niko to repay him for his help in the diamond deal.When Niko meets Florian (the possible traitor) he realizes that he could not be the one who betrayed them, also it can be seen that Florian (now called Bernie) is homosexual in a strange but funny scene.Niko and Bernie become good friends, and Niko helps Bernie's boyfriend (Deputy Mayor Bryce Dawkins) ward off the blackmailers.</p>
        <h3>Niko meets the traitor</h3>
        <p>Niko personally meets Pegorino's leader Jimmy Pegorino who first asks niko to kill Boccino, as he suspects he may be an undercover police officer.United Liberty Paper (A company that niko works for, because one of his ex-girlfriends, Michelle, was an agent who blackmailed him to work for them) gives Niko the person he was looking for, Darko, who is the traitor.Darko admits to betraying them and the player is free to kill him or not in the game, though Roman tells Niko not to do so.</p>
        <h3>The final mission</h3>
        <p>in the final event of the game Jimmy Pegorino asks niko to help him with a heroin exchange deal, in collaboration with dimitri.This clearly puts niko in a difficult situation, as he still wants to take revenge on dimitri for what he did to him.At this point the player can also decide which way to go: either take revenge on Dimitri or accept the deal with him.the game has two possible endings depending on the player's decision:</p>
        <h3>Final 1</h3>
        <p>If niko accepts the deal dimitri betrays them and steals all the heroin, then at roman's wedding, an assassin is sent to kill niko, but ends up accidentally killing roman.After this occurs the final mission where niko with the help of little jacob finally kills dimitri (who had killed pegorino).</p>
        <h3>Final 2</h3>
        <p>If niko decides to take revenge on dimitri, niko simply looks for and finds dimitri on the same cargo ship where nico arrived in the united states.Niko Kills dimitri, after this pegorino sends assassins to kill niko (also at roman's wedding), but these assassins kill kate, who is niko's girlfriend.Later, niko with the help of little jacob and roman track pegorino, and finally niko put and end to him.</p>

        <h2>personal opinion </h2>
        <p>I think the game is really fun and its plot may be dramatic and dark at times.The graphics looks great compared to gta san andreas (the prevous game) and you will have different events with the npc's but less than in gta 5 (the later game)  </p>
        <p>Some gameplay features are a bit annoying like driving, which is awkward and confusing for players.Another thing that is negative about the game is that it has missions that feel unnecessary  and with very long shootings and awkwar  d gameplay.</p>
        <p>I like that the game has a more serious and dark atmosphere, you can even see that the graphics of the game reflect it.It does not have the same sense of humor of GTA san andres and GTA 5, but I think that's okay, it's a video game that innovated and treated its script a little more seriously.The decisions that the player makes during the game also seemed to me to be ok, since they give depth to niko, we can know what he really thinks, and the final decision changes the end of the game.</p>
        <p>There is no denying that the game has fun and action-packed missions, and the open world is the best part of the game.Exploring Liberty City and the activities it offers to the player is very addictive and entertaining.If you play the game you will see that you will not get bored in the city, exploring it is the most important part of the gameplay</p>

        <h3>Gerald McReary</h3>

In a mission, Niko can decide whether to kill him or his brother, Francis McReary.</p>
        <h3>Francis McReary</h3>
        <p>He is a very corrupt,cynical police officer (deputy police commissioner) who uses all kinds of criminal acts to maintain his power, including murder.Is a member of the McReary family.He asks Niko to kill Derrick McReary, because he thinks that he can reveal his misdeeds to the press. Niko can kill either of them, and no member of the mcreary family will find out about this.</p>
        <h3>Dimitri Rascalov</h3>
        <p>He is a Russian mobster, and he is the main antagonist of GTA 4.Despite committing all kinds of atrocities in Russia, they were able to immigrate to the United States due to a loophole in the immigration laws.Dimitri seemed to be a reasonable person, trying to convince Faustin to be more cautious with his methods.He was rather calm, he was the one who thought about how to do things correctly within the Russian mafia.Later in the course of the game we see Dimitri being treacherous, he betrayed faustin, ordering niko to kill him, he betrayed niko, allying himself with bulgarin and ordering niko's death, even in the final mission he also betrays and murders Pegorino.  </p>
        <h3>Mikhail Faustin</h3>
        <p>Mobter of Russian origin who led the organization before Dimitri ordered his death. He was violent and irrational due to his addiction to alcohol; it can be said that this was conducive to his death. </p>

        <h3>Jimmy Pegorino</h3>
        <p>He is the lider of the Pegorino Family, he took over the family when his father died. We can also see that the pegorino family is very at odds with others like the Ancelottis family.He and his assistants gave numerous missions to niko, who had gained his trust by saving his life in a deal with the pavanos (they had tried to kill him and stole everything), and one of those missions was to kill several members of the pavanos.</p>
        <h3>Kate McReary</h3>
        <p>She is the only sister in the McReary family, and Niko's girlfriend. Patrick McReary trusted Niko so much that he allowed him to date his sister.she really is not a criminal like her siblings, in fact she had to go to therapy because of the violent things she saw every day.She has a calm personality and likes Niko even though she doesn't approve of his criminal life.She is a bit demanding with Niko, also she never allows him to have sex with her, since apparently she is someone very conservative</p>

        <h2>Reviews and reception</h2>
        <p>The reviews of the game were generally positive, highlighting the atmosphere of the city, the plot of the game, the open world, the possibilities the player has, the novel plot, etc.GTA 4 has a 9.8 metacritic rating, making it the second highest rated game on this page.</p>
        <p>Most reviewers enjoyed the game's darker tone and the player's choices in the narrative.Many felt that niko is a relatable and likable character, but even more so in the difficult situations he faces.Improvements to the combat system such as the cover system and the targeting system were well received.These improvements increased the fluidity, and decreased the difficulty when the missions were very long.</p>
        <p>The driving in gta 4 feel more realistic,although some people were a bit annoyed by this aspect.But the physics and animations of the game were very innovative for its time, so the critics loved them.</p>
        <p>The soundtrack of the game, with licensed music, and own compositions, was thought to be suitable to the plot of the game and the moment of the history it represents.Reviewers loved the sound design, including the sound effects throughout liberty city and the work on the voice acting.</p>

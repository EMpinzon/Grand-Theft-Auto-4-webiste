                    <p >GTA 4 is a videogame that was released in april 2008.   </p>
                    <p>It is the sixth main instalment in the game series.The protagonist is Niko Bellic who is an immigrant that came to the us to escape his tragic and criminal past.He also wants to meet his cousin again to start over his life</p>
                    <p>He goes through many problematic situations that make him return to crime to defend his life and that of his cousin. </p>

                    <h3 class="titulo2" >Release</h2>
                    <p>At E3 in May 2006 the game was announced and the game was released on April 24, 2008.The game was highly anticipated at the time, probably the most anticipated game of 2008.In 2009 two dlc packs were released for the xbox 360, which later in 2010 were available for ps3 and windows.these dlc were Grand Theft Auto IV: The Lost and Damned and Grand Theft Auto: The Ballad of Gay Tony, two separate stories that occur in the same time period, and whose events sometimes overlap.</p>
                    <p>These two dlc are also remembered by the community of GTA fans, for their charismatic characters and their interesting plots.</p>

                    <h3 class="titulo2">Script</h3>
                    <p>The script was done step by step, first a synopsis in which Dan Houser had the help of his brother Sam Houser and also Leslie Benzie's,then they were organizing the missions and their flow (based on the plot they had)</p>
                    <p>They put a lot of effort into the script, Dan Houser thought that the plot of the games should evolve into something deeper and not just copy scenes from famous movies.</p>
                    <p>They gave a lot of importance to Niko and his relationship with the people of the city, many characters being hostile towards Niko. Niko in the plot does not mind suffering and endangering his life, he just wants to protect his cousin and his revenge.But Niko does not kill for pleasure, he does it for the circumstances in which he is. Whenever he can, Niko refrains from hurting and sometimes saves other people that he considers innocent</p>
                    <p>The team focused on the missions not being so linear, which was something that characterized gta san andreas</p>
                    <p>Each important character in the game has a very representative personality, the developers thought it would be a good idea to use funny and serious characters at the same time to generate contrast (like niko and roman).Each location in the game is based on a New York location, the clothes, behaviors, dialogues, and even languages of the npc change according to the location where you are.</p>

                <article>
                    <h3 class="titulo2">Development</h3>
                    <p>The development of the game started just a month after the release of GTA San Andreas. Cases of employees working 12 hours during production were reported. A very interesting fact is that GTA 4 broke the record as the most expensive game in history, with production costs exceeding 100 million dollars. Today there are games with higher production costs, but GTA 4 was the most expensive of its time</p>
                    
                    <p>The team created npc with a variety of crazy personalities, Dan Houser described New York as a city full of crazy and fascinating people.</p>

                    <h3 class="titulo2">Liberty City</h3>
                    <p>The developers based Liberty City on New York City, this city also existed in previous games (GTA III), but they decided to make a totally new map, putting the most interesting of New York City in the design. We all know that New York City is one of the most representative cities of the United States.</p>
                    <p>Rockstar created a research team  to be based in New York City, who sent them the required information, plus hundreds of photos and videos of the city. The developers went further, they read about the architecture of the city, its sewage system, its subways, etc.It is interesting that liberty city has brands of fictitious companies, which the player can see in advertisements in the city.</p>

                    <h3 class="titulo2"> Art style </h3>
                    <p>The art of the game, that is, the images that you see in the menus, loading screens, cover art, etc... these images are the representation of the characters and the city.This art was redesigned, in gta 4 it is more detailed and realistic. The new art design is more suitable for the more serious and darker story it shows, it also suits the graphics of the game, which look more grey and dirty.</p>
                    <p>The more detailed art was possible thanks to the new consoles of that time, which already had hd technology included.The designers also wanted to change the cartoon-like art style of the previous games for a more visually striking art.</p>
                
                    <h3 class="titulo2">music</h3>
                    <p>The development team licensed music from many bands and musicians, this was quite costly, but it shaped the soundtrack of the game. Rockstar had to contact at least 2,000 people in order to get the songs for the game.They were even able to ask Jamaican dancehall artists to re-record their songs so that these songs make references to liberty city.</p>

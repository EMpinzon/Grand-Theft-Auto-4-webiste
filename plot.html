            <p>niko and roman are kidnapped by Mikhail Faustin's and Dimitri Rascalov's henchmen, russian mobsters, but faustin doesn't care much about vlad's death and simply forces niko to become his hitman. Dimitri is the second in command of that mafia, the lider , is faustin and  he ordered niko to assassinate the son of Kenny Petrovic, petrovic being one of the most important criminal leaders, and the most powerful russian mobster in the united states. Niko succeeds in killing petrovic's son, then petrovic threatens to kill all the members of faustin's criminal organization.Rascalov tells niko that it is best to kill faustin because of his violent personality and the erratic acts he was committing. </p>
            <h3 id="Escape to bohan">Escape to bohan</h3>
            <p>Niko and Rascalov make a plan to kill Faustin, and this plan worked, but then Rascalov reveals to Niko that he is  partner of Ray Bulgarin, who was his boss and believes that Niko had betrayed him in the past during a human trafficking operation. Niko and Little Jacob (Niko's partner) escaped alive from the shooting. Dimitri's men destroy Roman's apartment and taxi company, Roman's girlfriend Mallorie helps them escape to Bohan, where they hide out with Mallorie's cousins.</p>
            <p >Nico meets various local mob bosses in bohan (Playboy, Elizabeta, Dwayne), and does jobs for them.Niko is also forced by Francis McReary (police chief) to kill certain people he needs to get rid of.</p>
            <h3 id="Roman's kidnapping and the bank robbery">Roman's kidnapping and the bank robbery</h3>
            <p>Roman is kidnapped again by Dimitri's men, but Niko easily rescues him. Roman luckily receives insurance money, because his company was destroyed, so Roman rebuilds his company and buys an apartment in Algonquin. Niko meets Packie McReary (Francis McReary's brother), who is a member of the Irish mob,and starts working for them, also earns their trust and starts dating packie's sister, Kate McReary. Niko helps the McReary brothers to carry out a bank robbery, possibly the most remembered and emblematic mission of the game.</p>
            <h3 id="Ray Boccino and Florian">Ray Boccino and Florian</h3>
            <p>Niko meets Ray Boccino through packie, who gives Niko a job, it's about Niko supervising a diamond deal. This one goes wrong, and ends in a shootout between Niko and Bulgarin and finally the diamonds are lost in garbage.</p>
            <p>Ray helped niko track down the possible traitor that niko was looking for (who betrayed his squad in the  Yugoslavian Wars), ray did this for niko to repay him for his help in the diamond deal.When Niko meets Florian (the possible traitor) he realizes that he could not be the one who betrayed them, also it can be seen that Florian (now called Bernie) is homosexual in a strange but funny scene.Niko and Bernie become good friends, and Niko helps Bernie's boyfriend (Deputy Mayor Bryce Dawkins) ward off the blackmailers.</p>
            <h3 id="Niko meets the traitor">Niko meets the traitor</h3>
            <p>Niko personally meets Pegorino's leader Jimmy Pegorino who first asks niko to kill Boccino, as he suspects he may be an undercover police officer. United Liberty Paper (A company that niko works for, because one of his ex-girlfriends, Michelle, was an agent who blackmailed him to work for them) gives Niko the person he was looking for, Darko, who is the traitor.Darko admits to betraying them and the player is free to kill him or not in the game, though Roman tells Niko not to do so.</p>
            <h3 id="The final mission">The final mission</h3>
            <p>in the final event of the game Jimmy Pegorino asks niko to help him with a heroin exchange deal, in collaboration with dimitri. This clearly puts niko in a difficult situation, as he still wants to take revenge on dimitri for what he did to him. At this point the player can also decide which way to go: either take revenge on Dimitri or accept the deal with him. The game has two possible endings depending on the player's decision:</p>
            <h3 id="Final 1">Final 1</h3>
            <p>If niko accepts the deal dimitri betrays them and steals all the heroin, then at roman's wedding, an assassin is sent to kill niko, but ends up accidentally killing roman. After this occurs the final mission where niko with the help of little jacob finally kills dimitri (who had killed pegorino).</p>
            <h3 id="Final 2">Final 2</h3>
            <p>If niko decides to take revenge on dimitri, niko simply looks for and finds dimitri on the same cargo ship where nico arrived in the united states. Niko Kills dimitri, after this pegorino sends assassins to kill niko (also at roman's wedding), but these assassins kill kate, who is niko's girlfriend. Later, niko with the help of little jacob and roman track pegorino, and finally niko put and end to him.</p>

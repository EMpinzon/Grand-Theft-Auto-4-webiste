            <p>The reviews of the game were generally positive, highlighting the atmosphere of the city, the plot of the game, the open world, the possibilities the player has, the novel plot, etc. GTA 4 has a 9.8 metacritic rating, making it the second highest rated game on this page.</p>
            <p>Most reviewers enjoyed the game's darker tone and the player's choices in the narrative. Many felt that niko is a relatable and likable character, but even more so in the difficult situations he faces. Improvements to the combat system such as the cover system and the targeting system were well received.These improvements increased the fluidity, and decreased the difficulty when the missions were very long.</p>
            <p>The driving in gta 4 feel more realistic,although some people were a bit annoyed by this aspect. But the physics and animations of the game were very innovative for its time, so the critics loved them.</p>
            <p>The soundtrack of the game, with licensed music, and own compositions, was thought to be suitable to the plot of the game and the moment of the history it represents.Reviewers loved the sound design, including the sound effects throughout liberty city and the work on the voice acting.</p>
            <h3 id="Personal opinion">Personal opinion</h3>
            <p>I think the game is really fun and its plot may be dramatic and dark at times.The graphics looks great compared to gta san andreas (the prevous game) and you will have different events with the npc's but less than in gta 5 (the later game)  </p>
            <p>Some gameplay features are a bit annoying like driving, which is awkward and confusing for players. Another thing that is negative about the game is that it has missions that feel unnecessary  and with very long shootings and awkward gameplay.</p>
            <p>I like that the game has a more serious and dark atmosphere, you can even see that the graphics of the game reflect it. It does not have the same sense of humor of GTA san andres and GTA 5, but I think that's okay, it's a video game that innovated and treated its script a little more seriously. The decisions that the player makes during the game also seemed to me to be ok, since they give depth to niko, we can know what he really thinks, and the final decision changes the end of the game.</p>
            <p>There is no denying that the game has fun and action-packed missions, and the open world is the best part of the game. Exploring Liberty City and the activities it offers to the player is very addictive and entertaining. If you play the game you will see that you will not get bored in the city, exploring it is the most important part of the gameplay.</p>
